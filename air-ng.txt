1.Discovering Networks
	1.1 To put your wireless card into monitor mode: 
			$airmon-ng start wlan0
		result:
			PID		Name
			2025	NetworkManager
			2101	dhclient
			2971	wpa_supplicant
			
			
			Interface		Chipset				Driver
			
			wlan0		Realtek RTL8187L		rtl8187 - [phy1]
	1.2 To confirm it is in monitor mode run 'iwconfig' and confirm the mode
	
	1.3 start airodump-ng to look out for networks: 
			$airodump-ng wlan0
		ps: if msg show devise is busy be sure run 'ifconfig wlan0 down' and try again
		result:
			BSSID 		The MAC address of the AP
			PWR 		Signal strength. Some drivers don't report it
			Beacons 	Number of beacon frames received. If you don't have a signal strength you can estimate it by the number of beacons: 						the more beacons, the better the signal quality
			Data 		Number of data frames received
			CH 			Channel the AP is operating on
			MB 			Speed or AP Mode. 11 is pure 802.11b, 54 pure 802.11g. Values between are a mixture
			ENC 		Encryption: OPN: no encryption, WEP: WEP encryption, WPA: WPA or WPA2 encryption, WEP?: WEP or WPA (don't know yet)
			ESSID 		The network name. Sometimes hidden 
		
		 the clients found: 
			BSSID 		The MAC of the AP this client is associated to
			STATION 	The MAC of the client itself
			PWR 		Signal strength. Some drivers don't report it
			Packets 		Number of data frames received
			Probes 		Network names (ESSIDs) this client has probed 

			In the example above the net 00:01:02:03:04:05 would be the only possible target because it's the only one with an 
		associated client. But it also has a high signal strength so it's really a good target to practice.
	
	1.4 Sniffing IVs
			Because of the channel hopping you won't capture all packets from your target net. So we want to listen just on one channel and 
		additionally write all data to disk to be able to use it for cracking: 
			$airodump-ng -c 11 --bssid C8:6C:87:F2:07:4C -w dump wlan0
		
		result:
			 With the -c parameter you tune to a channel and the parameter after -w is the prefix to the network dumps written to disk. 
		The ”--bssid” combined with the AP MAC address limits the capture to the one AP. The ”--bssid” option is only available 
		on new versions of airodump-ng.
			
			Before being able to crack WEP you'll usually need between 40 000 and 85 000 different Initialization Vectors (IVs). Every data
		 packet contains an IV. IVs can be re-used, so the number of different IVs is usually a bit lower than the number of data packets
		 captured.
			
			So you'll have to wait and capture 40K to 85K of data packets (IVs). If the network is not busy it will take a very long time. 
		Often you can speed it up a lot by using an active attack (=packet replay). See the next chapter. 

		PS:
			How to see number of IV you can run 'cat dump-01.csv' and look at ',IV' column or look at '#Data'
